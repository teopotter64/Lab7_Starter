Check Your Understanding:

1) "Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed". Once you are sure the tests are working correctly and are comprehensive, using a github action is practical since it automatically tests pushed code, and a pull request can be modified such that unless the code passes the tests, it isn't accepted.
2) No, because E2E tests include testing of overall flow while a user is interacting with the website or app, not necessarily the correctness of an output.
